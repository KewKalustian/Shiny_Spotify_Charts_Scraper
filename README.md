# Spotify Charts Scraper â€“ A ShinyApp

Music streaming is an essential part of everyday music listening. Accessing data from music streaming service providers is often challenging. Making that kind of data retrieval more accessible, I developed an open-source web app that dynamically retrieves all available daily top 200 Spotify charts for each country and each date with audio features for each song in real-time. Hence, large datasets are retrievable and downloadable with only a few clicks so that further analyses with any statistical computing software are possible. Since this new app facilitates music streaming research substantially, I am excited to share this app with the community.

The app is now deployed on the DOT server of the German Society for Music Psychology:
